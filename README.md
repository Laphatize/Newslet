Newslet, is a tool that allows you to check if you are getting a reliable source of information. We don't keep track of the information you are verifying. Best of all, Newslet is open-source, you can see all the code thats responsible for verifying your content.

**How does it work?**</br>
Newslet checks websites known for it's reliabilty to see if the information you are viewing on your website is accurate. So, instead of you checking if the information is on other sites yourself, Newslet does it for you.
**When can you use it?**</br>
Newslet is planned to be released on August 7th, 2018. Seems like a long time, but the wait is worth it.

**Want to help with the development of Newslet?**<br>
Applications to become a beta-tester will come out soon. <br>
